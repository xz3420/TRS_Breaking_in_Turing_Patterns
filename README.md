## Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Turing Patterns

### Overview
This repository contains the source code and supporting materials for the research project on Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) breaking in Turing patterns. The project explores the mathematical and computational modeling of Turing patterns and their implications in reaction-diffusion systems.

### Repository Contents
- **Python code Main.ipynb**: This colab notebook contains the main computational models and algorithms used for analysing purpose.
- **Graphs**: Folder containing graphical outputs that supplement the research findings, illustrating key concepts and results.
- **Simulated Data**: This directory includes all the datasets generated and used during the simulations for this project.
